#1. Purpose
Value Help (F4 Help) CDS Views provide selectable lists of values for input fields in Fiori applications.
They enable users to search and select allowed values for standard fields such as Material (MATNR),
Customer (KUNNR), Plant (WERKS), Company Code (BUKRS), etc.

In RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model), value helps are implemented as CDS view entities with
data category VALUE_HELP and linked via annotations in the main consumption or interface view.

#2. Mandatory Annotations

@ObjectModel.dataCategory: #VALUE_HELP
  → Informs the system that this CDS entity is a value help.

@EndUserText.label: '<Short Description>'
  → Descriptive title for the value help entity.

@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED

@Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [
  { entity: '<ValueHelpEntity>', external: true }

]
  → Used in consumption views to link fields to the value help.

#3. Structural Requirements

- The entity must define at least one **key field** (typically the technical ID).
- Include one or more **descriptive text fields** for display in the F4 help dialog.
- Avoid SELECT * — explicitly list all fields.
- Ensure field names and data elements align with SAP naming conventions (e.g., `Material`, `MaterialText`, `Customer`, `CustomerName`).

#4. Naming Conventions

- CDS entity name format:
  Z_I_<BusinessObject>VH
  Example: Z_I_MaterialVH, Z_I_CustomerVH, Z_I_CompanyCodeVH
- Always it should start with Z and suffix with VH

#5. Examples of value help

@EndUserText.label: 'Value Help for Material'
@ObjectModel.dataCategory: #VALUE_HELP
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED

define view entity Z_I_MaterialVH
as select from I_Material as Material
{
key Material as Material,
MaterialText
}
